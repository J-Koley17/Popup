However, exceptions include immunity for the President and Governors under Article 361, protection for publishers of true parliamentary reports under Article 361-A, and immunity for members of Parliament and State Legislatures under Articles 105 and 194. Foreign sovereigns, ambassadors, and diplomats also enjoy immunity from legal proceedings.</p>

                <h2>Article 17: Abolition of Untouchability</h2>
                <p>Article 17 abolishes untouchability and prohibits its practice in any form, making it a punishable offense.

                <h2>Article 18: Abolition of Titles</h2>
                <p>Article 18 abolishes titles, barring the State from conferring titles on citizens or foreigners, except for military or academic distinctions. It prohibits Indian citizens from accepting titles from foreign states. Foreigners holding offices under the Indian State need the President's consent to accept titles from other countries. Additionally, no one in India can accept presents, emoluments, or offices from foreign states without the President's approval.</p>

            <h3>Case Example: State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar (1952)</h3>
            <p>In this landmark case, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 14 prohibits the State from arbitrarily classifying citizens for different treatment under the law. The Court struck down a law that allowed for special trial procedures for certain individuals, as it violated the principle of "equality before the law."</p>
